The dataset provided was from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Withing the datset there were several datasets that needed to be cleaned, segmented and combinded:features.txt, activity_labels.txt, subject_train.txt, x_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, x_test.txt, and y_test.txt

Below were the requirements for the project:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
